Why This Library Will Be Amazing
CSVInsight simplifies the headache of analyzing large CSV files by automating data profiling and using AI for advanced insights. Itâ€™s modular, so data scientists can extend or replace any component. The optional AI integration provides context-aware summaries that catch patterns a human might miss, saving hours of manual analysis. With easy installation, flexible chunking for big data, and a helpful CLI, CSVInsight transforms CSV analytics into a smooth and insightful experience.
