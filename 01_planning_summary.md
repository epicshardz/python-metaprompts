# Technical Project Planning Meta-Prompt (Python Edition) - Summary

In this prompt, we:

1. **Gather user input** about a Python project (library, CLI, or service) to be built.
2. **Generate a detailed plan** consisting of:
   - Project Identity (name, hook, features, constraints, target users)
   - Technical Architecture (key modules, data flow, CLI or API structure, packaging needs)
   - Implementation Components (breakdown of each major module or service)
   - Task Breakdown (each task has an ID, description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
   - Implementation Dependencies (Python versions, libraries, environment details)
3. **Offer an example usage** that demonstrates how to format user input in YAML.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive plan for a Python project thatâ€™s ready to be split into actionable tasks, implemented, and eventually packaged or deployed.
